# Questions: 
# 1. After looking at the scribbled post-it notes shared in the Scenario, 
#		I am assuming that they are written down in order to improve the calculation logic by testing it against the various dates from the 01st to 03rd to get the correct amount of fee?


# 2. For the query about The tax is not charged on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), public holidays, days before a public holiday and during the month of July.
#		I have implemented a json data store called toll_free_dates, and included some of the dates that includes the above, it is possible to add all of the above however I hope its ok to have just those for now?
#		Or if there exists an API that could retrive all of the holidays in Sweden would be really nice to have.
